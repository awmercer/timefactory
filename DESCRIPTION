Title: Create Running Timers
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Andrew", "Mercer", email = "andrew.mercer@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains the function \code{timefactory()} which is a factory function for creating
    individual running timer functions. A timer created using \code{timefactory()} returns the
    number of seconds that have elapsed since it was first created. It is intended as a less
    messy alternative to wrapping code in multiple calls to \code{proc.time()}.
